# Occamy GUI

This is a minimum example of building an occamy client.

It is based on the [bring](https://github.com/deluan/bring) implementation of the Guacamole protocol.

Note that `bring` is a software renderer that does not utilize Gio's GPU backend.
Hence there is a lot of improvements for building this application.

Later coding will revise the code into a gio accelerated rendering.
