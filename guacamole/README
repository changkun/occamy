 About this README
------------------------------------------------------------

This README is intended to provide quick and to-the-point documentation for
technical users intending to compile parts of Apache Guacamole themselves.

Source archives are available from the downloads section of the project website:
 
    http://guacamole.apache.org/

A full manual is available as well:

    http://guacamole.apache.org/doc/gug/


------------------------------------------------------------
 Required dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------

All software within guacamole-server is built using the popular GNU Automake,
and thus provides the standard configure script. Before compiling, at least
the following required dependencies must already be installed:

    1) Cairo (http://cairographics.org/)

    2) libjpeg-turbo (http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org/)
       OR libjpeg (http://www.ijg.org/)

    3) libpng (http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)

    4) OSSP UUID (http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/uuid/)


------------------------------------------------------------
 Optional dependencies
------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, the following optional dependencies may be installed in order to
enable optional features of Guacamole. Note that while the various supported
protocols are technically optional, you will no doubt wish to install the 
dependencies of at least ONE supported protocol, as Guacamole would be useless
otherwise.

    RDP:
        * FreeRDP (http://www.freerdp.com/)

    SSH:
        * libssh2 (http://www.libssh2.org/)
        * OpenSSL (https://www.openssl.org/)
        * Pango (http://www.pango.org/)

    VNC:
        * libVNCserver (http://libvnc.github.io/)

    Support for audio within VNC:
        * PulseAudio (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/)

    Support for WebP image compression:
        * libwebp (https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/)


------------------------------------------------------------
 Compiling and installing libguac, etc.
------------------------------------------------------------

All software within guacamole-server is built using the popular GNU Automake,
and thus provides the standard configure script.

1) Run configure

    $ ./configure

    Assuming all dependencies have been installed, this should succeed without
    errors. If you wish to install the init script as well, you need to specify
    the location where your system init scripts are located (typically
    /etc/init.d):

    $ ./configure --with-init-dir=/etc/init.d

    Running configure in this manner will cause the "make install" step to
    install an init script to the specified directory, which you can then
    activate using the service management mechanism provided by your
    distribution).

2) Run make

    $ make

    libguac, and any available protocol support libraries will now
    compile.

3) Install (as root)

    # make install

    All software that was just built, including documentation, will be
    installed.
